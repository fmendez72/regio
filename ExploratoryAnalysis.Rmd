# Descriptives I (Cross-country)
Thereâ€™s an issue with the cell count for the Regional level, which is accentuated when including the Dominant frames (see next section).

<br/><br/>

# Descriptives II (Frames)
There an issue with cell count when disaggregation of the Frames by country and level is explored. 

![](analysis/p1.png)

To overcome the problem of low or missing cell count we can reconceptualise at a higher level. The re-conceptualiastion, around Economics (socio-economic & values) vs Politics (governance & power), still fits concpetually while highlighting the overall problematique nicely: the Politics versus the Economics of CP.

# Descriptives: Dependent variables (Tone & Europeanization)
Both dependent variables are probablyt OK in terms of their distribution across the different groups of interest (although the lower regional level does have a very low count, especially the Tone variable. Europeanization has a slightly better distribution across categories.

<br/><br/>

# Descriptives: Stacked data format
Stacking the data marginally improves the cell count across outcomes of interest -not by a great amount. The main issue with stacking could be the case of Spain, and to a somewhat lesser extent France. 

The other obvious things that emerges is that you don't need regression analysis to realise that Frames drive Tone -it seems to be true by defintion or the relation of ideas.

<br/><br/>

# Methodology 
The dependent variables are ordered, Tone on a three-point scale (negative, neutral, positive), while Europeanization is also on a three-point scale (no Europeanization, medium-Europeanisation and high Europeanisation). 

Another element of the data is that has a nested structure: subframes > stories > sites > country. However,  the subframes > stories part nesting element is a bit problematic.

Give the data structure we fit an mixed effects Ordinal regression. The latter can handle the nested structure. We have [Country | Website] random effects and fixed effects for the core variables of interest.

# Model 1 (Determinants of Tone unstacked data)
First we fit a regular ordinal regression. We simple look at the dominant Tone and frames.

<br/><br/>

# Model 2 # (Determinants of Tone stacked data)
Here we fit a mixed effects ordinal regression. The results of the exploratory analysis can be seen below. The basic point is that further thought is needed on potential country attributes to include in the model
